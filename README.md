## [Arrow](https://next.arrow-kt.io/docs/) Docs

This beautiful library deserves a dash-docset. 
Help me to create a more discoverable version of this minimal example. 

To enable all features we will use [dashing](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing)
It is pretty straight-forward, we map [Dash Datatypes](https://kapeli.com/docsets#supportedentrytypes)
to Arrow. 

PR's are very welcomed ! 
Visit the [dashing website](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing) to get started and add
the appropriate mappings to dashing.json under selector.

### How to use it

- Go to Download Docsets 
-> Main Docsets 

- Under the Thread Docsets in the left corner there is a plus and go to -> Add Local Docs

- Currently it is a bit verbose because every link is specified as a class named Arrow, but that won't stay that long
